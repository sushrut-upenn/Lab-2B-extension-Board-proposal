# Lab-2B-extension-Board-proposal

Before putting forth our board proposal we have got our external LED blinking activity in action. We first executed the blinking LED using the attached file named Blinking LED. We modified the code to carry out the above action. We have also attached a video showing the execution.

After getting the blinking LED in action, we thought of modifying it to display a pattern using 6 LEDs where we used GPIO 22 to set first 3 LEDs high and then GPIO 23 to set rest 3 LEDs high and then set all of them high together. We also used white, red and blue LEDs specifically as these colors resonate with Upenn’s logo. We have attached the file name Pattern containing our modified code. We have also attached a video showing the execution.

Now talking about our proposal, we have thought of extending our pattern experiment by plotting a ‘P’ using white, red and blue LEDs which is basically Upenn’s logo. We might add more features and expand it depending on how our first step is executed.
